In addition to my professional endeavors, I have undertaken several learning journeys to enhance my knowledge and skills.

## 2023: Udemy - Microsoft Power BI Course
In early 2023, Barbas Bellfires conducted an in-house training program for Power BI usage. Over the past three years, I actively contributed to establishing the Barbas Bellfires Power BI environment and developed diverse dashboards. I completed this training, obtained the associated certificate, and my role extended beyond that of a participant; I served as an additional instructor during the course.

## 2021/2022: DataCamp Data Analyst/Scientist Course
Following two years of hands-on experience as a functional application administrator (XLS, SQL, VB, PBI), I aspired to further develop in the field of data analysis and science. Given the circumstances surrounding Covid, I opted for an online course through DataCamp. This trajectory covered various tools, with a concentration on Python and SQL. A range of topics was addressed, spanning from fundamental concepts to conducting Exploratory Data Analyses (EDA) and advanced machine learning techniques.

## 2018: NCOI bachelorâ€™s Industrial Engineering & Management
During this period, I was a member of the company's business bureau, where my responsibilities encompassed production planning, procurement of goods, and the configuration of bills of materials along with their associated production routings. This role served as the crucial link between the operational floor and the ERP system. Pursuing this education was a valuable complement to my knowledge, with a specific focus on in-depth analysis of processes and the pursuit of optimal efficiency.
